<h1>Northumbria Game Jam 2026:</h1>

<strong>Theme: Masks</strong>

Decided to go to the Northumbria Game Jam 2026 which lasted over the weekend, I decided to make a 2D game in PyGame (cause I have no idea how to make a 3D game and don't think I can learn it over the weekend haha), basic clicker game that has 3 types of entities (masquerade masks, normal faces, COVID masks) that all give you different points.

You start with 100 points and can gain more by clicking masquerade masks/COVID masks, you lose them by clicking face masks, below are more features.

<ul>
  <li>Start screen with instructions and a pause screen.</li>
  <li>Classes used to create multiple masks.</li>
  <li>Falling, spinning masks that randomly change.</li>
  <li>If the score goes below zero they lose and the game ends.</li>
</ul><br>
